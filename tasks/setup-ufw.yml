# XXX 2014-07-08 michael nelson ip6 not supported on image (?)
# ufw errors unless you switch off ipv6 support. Not sure if it's
# related to the kernel used on the cloud image, but the actual
# error is:
# ip6tables v1.4.21: can't initialize ip6tables table `filter':
# Table does not exist (do you need to insmod?)
# Perhaps ip6tables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.

# XXX 2014-07-30 michael nelson: It'd be much nicer if we could
# just render a config file for ufw, as it would be idempotent.
# As it is, there isn't a way to do that (afaics), so instead we
# reset the firewall rules each time based on the current clients.
